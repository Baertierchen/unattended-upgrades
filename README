Unattended upgrades
-------------------

This script will install security upgrades automatically and 
unattended. It will not install packages that require stuff
that can't be fetched from security and it will check for
conffile prompts before the install and keep the package back
that creates them. 

By default it will only install only from the the (Ubuntu,
dapper-security) repository. But this can be changed with the 
"Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins" apt configuration list.
It can be configured to allow any (origin, archive) combination
(those values are taken from the "Release" file on the archive 
server). It is recommended to use the default (only security updates
from Ubuntu).

See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticUpdates for details.
