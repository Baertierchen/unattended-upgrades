Unattended upgrades
-------------------

This script will install security upgrades automatically and
unattended. It will not install packages that require dependencies
that can't be fetched from security and it will check for conffile
prompts before the install and holds back the package that creates
them. 

By default it will only install only from the the (Ubuntu,
dapper-security) repository. This can be changed with the
"Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins" apt configuration list.  It can
be configured to allow any (origin, archive) combination. Those values
are taken from the "Release" file on the archive server. It is
recommended to use the default (only security updates from Ubuntu).

All operations will be logged in /var/log/unattended-upgrades/. This
includes the dpkg output as well.

this feature.

The following configuration options are supported via the standard 
apt configuration: 
"APT::UnattendedUpgrades::LogDir"
"APT::UnattendedUpgrades::LogFile"
"Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins"
"Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist"
"Unattended-Upgrade::Mail"
